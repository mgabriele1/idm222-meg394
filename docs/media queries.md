# Media Queries
## Responsive Web Design History
- accessible on any technology (various screen sizes)
- adjusts with screen size
- want things done as quickly and cheaply as possible
    - m dot - mobile version built seperately
    - watered down experience - no real functions
    - 3 different versions to maintain
- CSS rules to apply layouts to conditions regardless of screen size
    - as size changes rules change
    - one code base
- <b> Media Queries </b>
    - CSS rules that apply when certain requirements are met
    - example:
        - @media (min-width: 768px) {
            - div.wrapper {
            - background-color: green;
            - color: yellow;
            - max-width: 900px;
            - }
        - }
- massive device fragmentation
    - many different screen sizes provided by many different companies

## How to Begin Responsive Design
- hierarchy of content
    - order for culture (US reads left to right)
- MOBILE FIRST
    - design and code mobile first
    - solve most difficult problems first (small canvas)
    - helps to decide what is really important and ensure content fits
- CSS initially everything you need to make it work in the smallest screen size
    - start making screen bigger/ wider
    - when things look weird: add media query
- <b> can add a break point to fix just one thing </b>
- USE DEV TOOLS IN BROWSER TO WORK WITH SCREEN SIZE
- check work on as many different devices and browswrs as possible
---
## Steps
- < meta name="viewport" ... />
    - tell browser site is mobile friendly
    - <b> google ranks mobile meta tag higher </b>
    - contains: content, user-scale, width, maximum-scale
    - example:
        - < meta name="viewport"
        - content="initial-scale=1.0, (initial scale is 1)
        - user-scalable=no, (user cannot pinch zoom)
        - width=device-width,
        - maximum-scale=1.0" /> (sets zoom in limit to 1)
    - want users to zoom - bad eyes, images, etc.
    - WANT initial scale and width
- fluid design uses scalable sizing - percentages
    - these units are based on the pixel screen size
    - fluid containers, font sizes, etc.
        - 100% means 100% of user preference
        - not set 100% is about 16px
    - responds to amount of space available
---
## What's Next
- look at design from mobile first standpoint
- start incorporating media queries
- can look at:
    - width and height of viewport
    - width and height of device
    - orientation
    - resolution (1x, 2x, 3x) - better resolution images
    - available features - is the browser smart enough to know about certain types of code
    - other device capabilities
- media types
    - print
        - set up style sheet for case of print
    - screen
    - speach
---
## Set up Media Query
- if result is true, rules are applied
- if not true, rules outside of query will be applied
- example
    - @media screen and (win-width:480px)
    - screen and width less than 480px
- <b> Style sheet ordering </b>
    - general styles
    - mobile first styles
    - media queries (resize and add when needed)
---
## Example Notes
- : calls outermost element
- make variabeles in css (--name)
    - ex: --blue: #hexcode;
    - now when you want this shade you can call "var(--blue)" (NEED --)
- can call custom properties referencing other custom properties
    - --primary: var(--blue);
    - when you want your primary color you can now just call --primary
    - can now call media queries and change primary and not have to change every color
- put custom properties in root element so they can be used anywhere down the page
    - if variable is created in h1, will only be available to be called for h1 elements
- *, *:before, *:after 
    - calls every element and every element that appears before and after
    - <b> considered a CSS best practice 2020 </b>
- verticle rythm
    - margins only on top or bottom
- pseudo selector (box p: last-child)
    - chooses last of p element in box container
- <b>SOME BROWSERS HAVE A BUG WITH MEDIA QUERY AND REM UNITS</b>
    - do not use rems with media query
    - EMS is the relative unit to use
- <b> DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF IN YOUR CODE </b>
### GOES AWAY WITH FLEXBOX
- overflow
    - specifies what should happen if content overflows an element's box
    - whether to clip content or to add scrollbars when an element's content is too big to fit in a specified area
    - overflow property only works for block elements with a specified height.
- overflow: auto; to be used with float
- when <b>float</b> must provide a width
---
## Breaking CSS into multiple files
- different files for each screen size
- import the CSS file
- downsides
    - another file for browser to load
    - another file to keep track of
    - will be difficult to determine what belongs to what size
    - queries will be addressing small things
    - one file - fixes can naturally progess as you go down the page
